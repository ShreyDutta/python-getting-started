    "## 1. On Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "I order to use python for neurostimulation, we should install python on the computer first. Most computers already have some version of python, but this is for our purposes totally unacceptable. Tampering with that usually will break your system. The only recommended way to use python is therefore in a safe, disposable sandbox environment in which you can screw up as badly as possible with impunity without ever inavertently adversly affecting the rest of your computer even in the slightest. Think of the installation and use of this sandbox environment as installing and running Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a **Virtual Environment**. The name is indeed a little 'virtual', and to me that strikes as 'vague', but its purpose is clear: containing your python installation and associated packages for a specfic application. Each environment has a specific **name** that you give to it. For example a stimulus presentation environment might be called *st*, while an analysis environment might be called *eeganalysis*. The nice thing is that you can install different python packages of different versions in your different environments without affecting each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are in the python world several virual environment softwares:\n",
    " - pipenv\n",
    " - virtualenv\n",
    " - venv\n",
    " - anaconda\n",
    " - miniconda\n",
    " - conda\n",
    " \n",
    "This seems a bit mind-boggling (to me it was anyway), and this is what you get in open-source community: Lots of different people work on overcoming an (often occurring!) problem with different kinds of ideas and coming from their own situations, and thereby come up with lots of different solutions. There is only ONE solution to use for our purposes, and you can forget all the rest. I did mention them because you will definitely run into them as you go along. The only one really good solution (and that you must use) is **miniconda**. A short word about conda, miniconda and anaconda. **conda** is the *actual* Software, whereas miniconda and anaconda are more descriptive of the repositories of python packages shipped in the download. Miniconda is the best because it comes with less bulk. Anaconda also as a GUI which is a bit too slow for my tastes.\n",

    "https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/\n",
    "For Neurostimulation on WINDOWS, I would recommend downloading the 32-bit package, NOT the 64-bit! - If you download the 64-bit, you won't be able to send triggers via the Parallel Port. I think for Mac or Linux it doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Download the latest version of conda and try to install it** There's some questions, go with the basic answers. If you get confused google whatever it means and try to make it work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you install it, on Linux you get conda set up in the bash terminal; I think on Mac OS X it should also be callable with the terminal; on Windows you get the Anaconda prompt. Start up the terminal, and check if things work (The \\$ signifies that it is a terminal):\n",

    "You have to specify python=3 so it will grab its own dedecated python interpreter and not use the main (OS system) one. You will see a lot of text garble, and some questions. Answer yes to all of them. Once this is done, you have created the conda environment called stimulation. But are are not yet inside this environment. Go inside it, by doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",

    "```\n",

Now that we are inside, we can do whatever we like in here in terms of installation and set up, and we will be completely safe to mess up, start again, and do whatever. A note on the 'base' environment that you might've seen earlier: do not tamper with the base environment and make sure you're never in the base environment when you wish to try anything. That is the system's own environment (so no touch, unless you know what you're doing).\n",
